# Concepts that I learnt about Blockchains

## 1. Smart Contract

It is simply a program that stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. This is work by following simple statements that are written into code on a blockchain. It helps to improve the speed, efficiency, and security. One drawback of smart contracts is, they can't acquire information about real-world events because, they can't send HTTP queries. 

## 2. Proof of Work

Proof of work is a decentralized consensus technique that requires network participants to spend time solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to compete against each other to complete transactions on the network. It allows the blockchain to come to consensus.
